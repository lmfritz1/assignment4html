    <h1>My Ultrarunning, Hiking, and Traveling Adventures</h1>
    <p>From the mountains of <a href="Baxter_Park.jpg">Maine</a>, into the <a href="Missouri_Cave.jpg">Midwest</a>, and to the beautiful beaches of <a href="Sanibel_Run.jpg">Florida</a>, my ultrarunning and traveling journeys have allowed me to breathe the freshest of air, reconnect with nature, and witness the most gorgeous sunrises and <a href="Florida_Sunset.jpg">sunsets</a> available to humans.</p>

        <h3>Sanibel Island beach run.</h3>
        <p>In March of 2021 my boyfriend and I spent seven days roasting in the sun, drinking frozen margaritas, and gathering thousands of seashells on the beautiful beaches of Sanibel Island. We took this trip to get an early start on our summer tan, reconnect with nature and ourselves, and escape the frenzied lifestyle of Washington DC. </p>

        <h3>Florida Gulf Coast sunset while traveling early this year!</h3>
        <p>This sunset photo was taken while we were on our beach vacation this past March. This particular evening we stayed out on the beach until almost midnight watching the sunset go down and the starry night sky coming alive. The stars were out so bright and what a magnificent sight!</p>
